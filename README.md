# 10-Object-oriented-SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

This Logo Generator allows anyone to create a simple logo quickly, without having to hire and pay a graphic designer.
You can use this simple terminal application, just by answering prompts to generate a simple logo for you.
I learned here, how to use Object Oriented Programming to my advantage by creating classes with similar characteristics.
Writing test was another important part, that helped me write much more efficient code, that can be tested quickly.
A sample logo is inside the examples folder named 'logo.svg'

Copy this project into your repository, initialize npm ('npm init -y') and install inquirer@8.2.4 for the prompts and jest to run the tests. -->('npm i inquirer@8.2.4' & 'npm i jest')

## Usage

Run the application with 'node index.js' in your terminal in the root directory.
From there you will be first prompted to enter up to three characters for your logo, then choose the text color('keyword or hex color'), choose between the three shapes:
"Triangle, Circle and Square",
and choose the shape color ('keyword or hex color')(Recommended to choose colors that you can see on top of another!).

And there in the examples folder, is your newly generated 'Logo.svg' file.

Open the file in a browser or with other applications to see your
